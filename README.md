# Deep Learning Homework: Charity Funding Predictor

![ImageCharity](https://andarba.org/asset/images/Charity-about-us.png)

# Overview 

Create an algorithm for the non-profit foundation, Alphabet Soup, to predict whether or not applicants for funding will be successful using machine learning and 
neural networks. 

# Resources 

* Jupyter
* Pandas
* Keras
* Tensorflow 
* Sklearn

# Results 

## Preprocess the Data

* Data read and preprocessed
* Target variable: 'IS_SUCCESSFUL'
* Feature variables: 'APPLICATION_TYPE', 'AFFILIATION', 'CLASSIFICATION', 'USE_CASE','ORGANIZATION', 'STATUS', 'INCOME_AMT', 'SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS', 'ASK_AMT.' 
* Neither Target or Features and removed: 'EIN' and 'NAME'
 

## Compile, Train, and Evaluating the Model

Using TensorFlow, design a neural network, or deep learning model, to create a binary classification model that can predict if an Alphabet Soup–funded 
organization will be successful based on the features in the dataset. Next, determine the number of neurons and layers in the created model to compile, train, 
and evaluate the binary classification model to calculate the model’s loss and accuracy. Save and export results to an HDF5 file.
